# Code hygiene and maintenance

This is the live owner for `HYG` rows in [TODO](../TODO.md). The author asked
for source-file splits and comment audits on 2026-10-28. These are independent
maintenance slices alongside the gameplay backlog; they do not change its
arena/tuning order.

## Scope and working rules

File length identifies candidates to inspect, not a maximum or a reason to cut
a cohesive implementation. Preserve the game's inheritance, public signatures,
names, layouts and behavior. Engine and vendored code are outside this pass.
Keep historical review documents as written.

For a split, move whole definitions and their private helpers together wherever
possible. Preserve evaluation, callback, RNG, diagnostic and floating-point
operation order. Do not combine a split with bug fixes, renaming, broad
formatting, a new abstraction model or gameplay changes. An extraction that
needs new private parameters must say so; it is not a literal source move.

Register new game translation units in [game/CMakeLists.txt](../game/CMakeLists.txt),
with the existing PCH, include and warning conventions. The
[acceptance runner](../scripts/run-acceptance.ps1) already compiles a case's
same-named folder of `.cpp` files. Header-based visual/document fixtures have
their own inclusion context; preserve it or wire an explicit replacement.

Review the moved definition bodies and narrow build/include changes, then build
Debug and Release and run the existing checks named in each scope. Do not add
tests that merely mirror a move. Comment-only work needs caller/implementation
review and a comment-only diff, not a new runtime test suite. Keep structural
changes and behavioral defects in separate commits when implementation lands.

## Source-size snapshot (2026-10-28)

These counts include blank lines and comments in tracked authored files. Refresh
the affected files before starting; this is audit evidence, not a permanent size
gate. The earlier figure/animation and other source splits already exist.

| file | lines | audit result |
|---|---:|---|
| [presentation_validation.cpp](../game/presentation_validation.cpp) | 2,502 | Ordered helper extraction, `HYG#1`; one large function prevents a simple method move |
| [player.cpp](../game/objects/player.cpp) | 1,848 | Retain the coupled movement/contact/carrier core; figure code is already separate |
| [input_bindings.cpp](../scripts/acceptance/input_bindings.cpp) | 56 | Four topic sources and shared fixtures; `HYG#5` complete |
| [evidence-record.ps1](../scripts/check-painter/evidence-record.ps1) | 1,403 | Evidence-metadata groups, `HYG#6` |
| [painter_visual.cpp](../scripts/acceptance/painter_visual.cpp) | 1,347 | Retain the explicit include/setup/dispatch entry; no registry redesign selected |
| [level.cpp](../game/objects/level.cpp) | 966 | Horizontal-motion subsystem extracted (380 lines), `HYG#2` complete |
| [tune_colour_document_checks.h](../scripts/acceptance/debug_console/tune_colour_document_checks.h) | 17 | Ordered topic coordinator; `HYG#7` complete |
| [tuning.cpp](../game/tuning.cpp) | 907 | Retain cohesive key-by-key parsing and validation |
| [level_document.cpp](../editor/level_document.cpp) | 949 | Retain the shared document transaction; `ED#7` save protection complete |
| [projectile.cpp](../game/objects/projectile.cpp) | 287 | Contacts/sweeps extracted (587 lines), `HYG#3` complete |
| [weapon.cpp](../game/objects/weapon.cpp) | 855 | Retain the current firing/lifecycle core; motion already has its own file |
| [save.cpp](../game/save.cpp) | 602 | Profile overlay extracted (209 lines), `HYG#4` complete |

## Ordered presentation validation (`HYG#1`)

**OPEN, L.** `Presentation::validate_resources` accounts for roughly 2,150
lines of the largest source file. Its lambdas and page/layout variables cross
topic boundaries, and its first-error order is intentional. Moving arbitrary
blocks to separate files without carrying that context would change or break
validation.

Extract private helpers by page/validation family with explicit required
context and an ordered coordinator, then distribute the helpers into coherent
translation units. This requires private helper extraction, rather than only
moving whole existing methods. Keep the public API, calculations, lookup order
and diagnostic text/precedence intact; do not introduce a generic validation
framework. `validate_stage_counts` and `sound_references` can move as complete
methods where they fit.

Acceptance: Debug/Release builds and existing `menu_text`, `menu_presentation`,
`weapon_catalog`, `stage_selection` and startup/content checks. Compare the
first diagnostic for existing invalid fixtures, including candidates with
multiple invalid fields. `ROAD#25`'s paper-face correction is qualified;
preserve its corrected face boundary and item diagnostic order as the baseline.

## Level horizontal motion (`HYG#2`)

**Done (2026-10-28).** Moved the horizontal admission helpers and all eight
motion query, admission/budget, prepare, commit, zero-step and snapshot methods
together into `game/objects/level_horizontal_motion.cpp` (380 lines). The
current `level.cpp` is 966 lines; its update coordinator and call order stay
in place. Public signatures, member layout, diagnostics and pre-step paint
ownership timing are unchanged.

Independent source comparison confirmed that the helper block and all moved
method bodies are identical, including their float/double arithmetic. The
remaining implementation differs only by the move and includes. Debug and
Release builds and the existing `moving_structure`, `paint_ferry`,
`fixed_slab`, `movement` and `instant_replay` checks pass. Debug retains the
manual/public-loader checkpoint, paint-credit and terminal-RNG replay checks;
the shipping seven-arena replay passes in both configurations.

## Projectile contacts and sweeps (`HYG#3`)

**Done (2026-10-28).** Moved the private sweep/relative-impact helpers and
all eleven definitions from `resolve_launch_obstruction` through
`flush_paint_audio` into `game/objects/projectile_contacts.cpp` (587 lines).
Construction, diffusion, movement, lifetime and accessors remain in the
287-line `projectile.cpp`; the contact helpers remain private to their new
translation unit.

Independent block comparisons confirm identical definitions and retained
sweep ordering, launch exemptions, relative moving-surface geometry,
endpoint deduplication and impact/paint/audio callback order. This only moves
source and adjusts includes/registration. Debug and Release builds and
`blocked_shot`, `tunnelling`, `moving_structure`, `fixed_slab`, `paint` and
`instant_replay` pass, including Debug's public-loader replay checks.

## Save profile overlay (`HYG#4`)

**Done (2026-10-28).** Moved `copy_slot`, the play-preference/binding setters,
effective-preference accessors and profile/wearing/Boost operations into
`game/save_profiles.cpp` (209 lines). The 602-line `save.cpp` retains JSON
sections, migration, loading and atomic writing. Display settings stay with
the resolution conversion used by serialization; they have no profile overlay.

Independent comparison confirms identical helper and method bodies, including
effective-reference identity, per-slot association, mutation/write order and
failure semantics. The public API and save schema are unchanged. Debug and
Release builds and the existing `player_profiles`, `settings`,
`input_bindings`, `handicap` and `remembered_setup` checks pass, including
isolated real write/replacement failures, active-setting recovery and reloads.

## Input-binding acceptance topics (`HYG#5`)

**Done (2026-10-28).** The 56-line `input_bindings` entry retains `main` and
the single fake `GamepadReader`/state seam. Four topic sources hold independent
domain/oracle checks, actual reader/resume checks, save/schema/relaunch checks
and keyboard actions. `fixtures.h` shares only the required fixtures, literal
oracle tables and declarations; the acceptance runner discovers the sources.

Exact source-group comparisons preserve all assertion/oracle literals,
function bodies, invocation order and isolated profile lifetimes. Shared names
now use `input_bindings_acceptance`; defaults live on declarations and shared
constant tables have inline linkage. No production helper replaces an oracle.

The existing `input_bindings` case passes in Debug and Release. In each
configuration, separate `relaunch-write` and `relaunch-read` processes also pass
against the same retained private profile, preserving the real persisted-J
reader and unchanged-save checks. No player data or hardware is used.

## Painter evidence metadata (`HYG#6`)

**OPEN, M.** The evidence script has a base ordered record, a long focused-scope
precedence chain and common final fixups. Extract its branch bodies into
coherent arena, menu/text, colour and action/HUD groups; keep the base,
selection precedence and final fixups explicit in the entry script.

Preserve dot-sourced variable scope, ordered keys, exact evidence strings,
path selection and failure behavior. The runner loads this before its `try`,
so relocating a failure is also a behavior change. Avoid replacing the chain
with an implicit registry or changing the painter matrix.

Acceptance: parse all resulting PowerShell files and evaluate old/new metadata
construction for every focused switch in both presets, comparing ordered
output with only revision/working-tree metadata normalized. Exercise combined
switch precedence too, then run representative existing focused native leaves.
A full painter matrix is not needed solely for moved metadata, and a higher
timeout is not a substitute for preserving it.

## Colour-document fixture families (`HYG#7`)

**Done (2026-10-28).** The 17-line `check_colour_document` entry coordinates
six topic helpers in four headers: splice/alias behavior, selectors/feedback,
opening artwork, and HUD/figure/identity colours. The interleaved additions
retain their original order: generic, feedback, opening art, HUD,
crack/acting, then limbs/identity. All headers keep the original anonymous
namespace and `last_key` inclusion context.

Reconstructing the original function body from those ordered helper bodies
reproduces all 1,038 lines unchanged after physical newline normalization.
Literal JSON, source-span assertions, conflict/reset checks and byte-preserving
fixtures are unchanged; no production accessors or registration were added.
Independent review and the existing `debug_console` case pass in Debug and
Release, including Release's executable exclusion checks.

## Source-comment contract audit (`HYG#8`)

**Done (2026-10-28).** Corrected the three bounded comment groups against
current implementations and callers. Source edits are comments only; the
executable tokens, APIs, member layouts and behavior are unchanged. An
independent caller review agreed with the corrections. No new runtime tests
were added for this comment-only slice.

Completion evidence, by edited declaration or claim:

| comment location | verified implementation/caller |
|---|---|
| `PlayerBuilder::build_players` declaration and local identity comment | `player_builder.cpp` keeps roster order, increments `human_view` only for humans, passes participant to sound and `paint_owners::index(setting.num, participant_index)` to the weapon |
| `MenuPlayerSettings::num`, `MenuLevelSettings::device_slot` and `Player::player_num` | `menu_level_settings.cpp` assigns human slots, gives bots `-1` and remaps only the device; `Level::apply_player_inputs` reads stable slots; `results_menu.cpp` maps participants through `paint_owners::index` |
| `paint_owners.h` owner-domain comment and `Player` constructor's sound comment | `PlayerBuilder` uses slot-based human paint credit and participant-derived bot credit; the constructor receives a separate participant sound index |
| `Level` participant/pane, feedback and acting comments | `Level` constructs `view_participants_` only for humans; `take_rumble_events` retains `player_num()`; `level_dev_tools.cpp` indexes players by participant; `level_draw.cpp::refresh_identity_texts` falls back to bot difficulty or human device; `level_intro.cpp::update_acting` and `draw_acting` index `acts_` alongside `players_` |
| `Level::update`, `DebugDirector::update_match`, `GameLevel` adapter declarations and `game_level_dev_tools.cpp` heading | `game_states.cpp::update` calls the director in both builds; the Release inline hook forwards to `debug_update_level`, which supplies `RoundTapeRecorder`; `game_level_replay.cpp::step_replay` supplies `RoundTapePlayer` |
| `Level` shipping setup/replay adapter comment | `game_states.cpp` calls `set_pad_devices` during build and update; `game_level_replay.cpp::start_replay` restores pad mappings and cheats |
| `DebugDirector` Release overview | `debug_director.h` retains ordinary update forwarding and `opening_mode` pass-through; `debug_director.cpp::run_launch_arguments` retains the Release argument warning |
| `RoundTape` invalidation overview | `GameLevel::debug_place`, `debug_respawn` and `debug_kill` call `spoil`; `RoundTape::set_cheats` spoils after a recorded step; `tune_commands.cpp` applies live edits without tape invalidation; the `ROAD#19` owner records that exception and Debug-injected suspends |
| `GameData::stages` and `MenuLevelSettings::set_stage` | `stage_loading.cpp` appends accepted user definitions after manifest stages in file-name order; `MainMenuStageSelect::set_level_settings` chooses the selected stage's registry name |
| `LevelDocument::unresolved_resources` and `LevelLoadedInfo::validate_content` icon comments | both still check `icon_frame` in `sprite_sheet_1`; `MainMenuStageSelect::update_stage_select_visuals` selects `StagePreview`, not the legacy icon |

The accurate `stage_loading.h` rescan, borrowed-registry and no-match lifetime
comments were retained: `GameMenu::init` lends the callback to Stage Select,
whose main-menu entry rescans, while between-round entry does not. Missing
definitions remain registered but unreachable from the stage list. Historical
reviews and the engine's design decisions were left untouched.
